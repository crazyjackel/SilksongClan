## Overview

***They see your beauty, so frail and fine, they see your peace, woven of faith and toil, forget your heart, bound in slumber and servitude, when you wake they shall see your truth, A beast's nature bare to all.***

The Hollow Knight Silksong Clan is a clan based on the recent release of Hollow Knight Silksong. Fight the challenges of Heaven and Hell as Hornet, the ancient protector of Hallownest, and her spunky allies. 

Mechanically, the Clan focuses in on a few core new mechanics:

## Silk

Gain Silk through attacking enemies and use it as part of the cost for specific powerful cards. Silk sticks with you from floor to floor so be sure to farm it as best you can.

Mechanics:
Warrior. Units with Warrior, when they strike a foe, they gain 1 silk.
Silksong. Whenever a Card is casted that expends Silk, this will trigger an ability.

##  Acrobatics: By avoiding damage through a series of helpful cards, gain a series of buffs. Move in order not to die.

Mechanics:
Imbue. A Buff that is lost upon damage. At the beginning of the turn, gain that much additional attack.
Protection. A Buff that is lost upon damage. At the beginning of the turn, gain that much additional max health.
Permanent Imbue. A Buff that is lost upon damage. At the beginning of the turn, the card gains that much additional attack permanently.
Permanent Protection. A Buff that is lost upon damage. At the beginning of the turn, the card gains that much additional max health permanently.
Imbue Bind. Gives a Unit additional attack equal to Imbue.
Protection Bind. Gives a Unit additional max health equal to Protection.
Bind. Gives a unit additional attack and max health equal to their Imbue and Protection.

Combos: Certain specific cards gain additional buffs if you play specific cards prior.

Combo [Card Type]: If a Card of the type was played as the previous card, this card card will receive an ability or buffs.
