## Overview

***They see your beauty, so frail and fine, they see your peace, woven of faith and toil, forget your heart, bound in slumber and servitude, when you wake they shall see your truth, A beast's nature bare to all.***

The Hollow Knight Silksong Clan is a clan based on the recent release of Hollow Knight Silksong. Fight the challenges of Heaven and Hell as Hornet, the ancient protector of Hallownest, and her spunky allies from the kingdom of pharloom. 

Mechanically, the Clan focuses on a few core new mechanics that capture the essence of Hollow Knight's combat and exploration:

## Core Mechanics

### Silk System
Silk is a new resource that represents Hornet's silk-weaving abilities. Cards now have both energy and silk costs, creating a dual-resource economy.

**How to Gain Silk:**
- **Warrior Trait**: Units with Warrior gain 1 silk when they strike an enemy
- **Silk Relics**: Various relics can increase your maximum silk capacity
- **Base Capacity**: Start with 12 maximum silk

**How to Spend Silk:**
- **Card Costs**: Many powerful cards require silk in addition to energy
- **Automatic Deduction**: Silk is automatically spent when playing cards with silk costs
- **Affordability**: Cards are only playable if you have enough silk

### Silksong Trigger
**Silksong** is a special trigger that activates whenever you play a card that costs silk. This creates powerful synergies between silk-spending cards and units with Silksong abilities.

### Status Effects

**Imbue**: A temporary buff that provides additional attack at the start of each turn. Lost when the unit takes damage.

**Protection**: A temporary buff that provides additional max health at the start of each turn. Lost when the unit takes damage.

**Permanent Imbue**: A permanent buff that increases attack. Lost when the unit takes damage.

**Permanent Protection**: A permanent buff that increases max health. Lost when the unit takes damage.

**Bind**: Gives a unit additional attack and max health equal to their current Imbue and Protection values.

### Combo System
Certain cards gain additional abilities when played after specific card types:

- **Combo [Subtype]**: If a card of the specified subtype was played as the previous card, this card gains additional effects
- **Combo [Card Name]**: If the specific named card was played as the previous card, this card gains additional effects

### Subtypes
- **Bug**: Insectoid creatures from Pharloom
- **Snail**: Wise, spiritual beings that provide support through Silksong connections
- **Flea**: Small, agile creatures that work together in swarms



## Champion: Hornet

Hornet, the princess-protector of Hallownest, serves as the champion for the Silksong Clan. She starts with 24 attack and 16 health, embodying the agile, needle-wielding warrior from the games.
